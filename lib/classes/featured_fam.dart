        """Then about a hundred years later, the ancestors of the Marashda family came to Beit Sahour as Christian pilgrims from "Rashda" in Egypt. They were called Oweis (ancestor of Khair family) and his brother Jiries (ancestor of Bannoura family). From the same town also came Awwad (ancestor of Awwad family) and Abu Shaghwiya (ancestor Ayyad and Badra families). At that time, the Marashda lived in caves under the houses of Jiries Gharib, Elias Ibrahim Khair and Jiries Khair in the Khair neighborhood in the middle of town, as well as caves in the nearby Ayyad neighborhood.

In the same period ancestors of the Kukali family from Al-Kukaliya in Syria came and lived with the ancestors of the Awwad family.

The Marashda family has four ancestors; two of them are brothers Oweis (ancestor of Khair family) and Jiries (ancestor of Bannoura family):

Oweis had Khair, whose name the family took and who later had four children, who were the ancestors of the Khair family branches:

Ibrahim Khair, the ancestor of the current Khair family and his sons: Khair, Abdullah, Khalil and Awad, the ancestors of the Khair family.

The second son of Khair Oweis is Musa (ancestor of Hawwash family), who had two sons: Salem (the ancestor of Baboul family) and Jacob, who in turn had Jaber and Hanna (known as Hawwash), the ancestors of the two main branches of the Hawwash family (Musa family).

The third son of Khair Oweis is Sa'eed, who had three sons: Hanna (ancestor of Tawil family), Sa'ad (ancestor of Sa'ad family) and Masa'ad (ancestor of Masa'ad family), which represent the three main branches of the Isa'ed family.

The fourth son of Khair Oweis is Gharib, who had two sons Salameh and Elias, the ancestors of the Gharib family.


The second ancestor of the Marashda family is Jiries (Jirjes Abu Thuraya), ancestor of the Bannoura family, which the family was called after his wife Bannoura, since Jiries had died early, after having two sons: Odeh and Ibrahim (who was called Abu Hashish for being funny). Jiries sons were then called the Bannoura' sons. Odeh had three children: Habrin, Jaber and Shehadeh, ancestors of the three branches of the Bannoura family. While Ibrahim had Hanna, who in turn got four children: Salim, Issa, Suleiman and Awad. Unfortunately, only Salim survived as the living ancestor of the current Abu Hashish family, one of the Bannoura family' branches.

The third ancestor of the Marashda family is Awwad (ancestor of Awwad family), as mentioned previously, who had his son Saleh, and Saleh had Issa, and Issa had three children: Moses, Abdullah and Salem, ancestors of the main branches of the Awwad family. The branch of the Kokali family connects to the Awwad family from Al-Kukaliya in Syria, as mentioned earlier, and their ancestor was Sulaiman who had his son Musa, and Musa had his son Salem, who in turn had his sons Saliba and Issa.

The third ancestor of the Marashda family is the ancestor of Ayyad family, and his name was Abu Shaghwiya. Abu Shaghwiya had a son, Abu Mahluka, and Abu Mahluka had Abu Shareb. Abu Shareb had Abu Ghattas, who had two children: Ayyad and Ibrahim, ancestors of Ayyad and Badra families. Ayyad had three sons: Jaber, Salem and Farhoud, who represent the major branches of the Ayyad family, while Ibrahim had two sons, Khader and Hanna, the ancestors of Badra family.
